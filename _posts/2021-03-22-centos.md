CentOS is a free of cost, enterprise-class Linux distribution, which recently switched to a rolling release. Created as an alternative to Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the project is a community-driven effort focused on delivering a robust open source ecosystem. It offers consistent manageable platform that suits a wide variety of needs along with extensive resources to build, test, release, and maintain code.
