Endless is a beginner-friendly distribution with an interface designed to "feel natural and intuitive", taking cues from mobile operating systems and presenting apps as a grid of icons right on main screen.

Something unique to Endless is that it comes pre-loaded not just with plenty of desktop apps, but with a bunch of web services and applications so they're just one-click away. Even in their own software store, Endless treats web applications as equal to those of the desktop.
