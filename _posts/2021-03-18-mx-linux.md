MX Linux is a cooperative venture between the [antiX](https://antixlinux.com/) and former [MEPIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEPIS) communities to make a distribution that provides an elegant Xfce desktop with simple configuration with a focus on stability and efficient use of system resources.

While it can be installed onto most PCs and Macs, MX Linux is also built to run from a USB drive and function as a portable operating system.
