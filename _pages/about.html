	<h3>About Compute Freely</h3>
	<p>Compute Freely was started to be an approachable and friendly jumping in point for people completely new to or curious about the world of Free and Open Source operating systems and Linux distributions with a focus on introduction and curation.</p>
	<h4>Introduction</h4>
	<p>Many people have no familiarity with Linux operating systems or the whole ecosystem of Free Software that surrounds it. By answering "<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/what-is-linux/">What is Linux?</a>" and "<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/why-use-linux/">Why Use Linux?</a>" Compute Freely aims to introduce people to some of the basic ideas and principles behind Linux and Free Software in an effort to get people to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/switching/">switch</a> away from proprietary systems.</p>
	<h4>Curation</h4>
	<p>Unlike some sites, Compute Freely does away with most of the technical jargon, detailed specifications and page-ranking to determine popularity when presenting distributions. Instead, each distribution gets a simple page with some essential information and a brief description and through the use of tags people can explore or browse related distributions.</p>
	<p>Compute Freely provides a <i>curated</i> selection of distributions, not a comprehensive list, as there are thousands out there and that would be overwhelming. The aim is to present the breadth of possibilities and cover a variety of interests and levels of familiarity with Free Software and Linux in general, which is broken into a few simple categories:</p>
	<p class="category beginner">beginner</p>
	<p>{% include categories/beginner.md %}</p>
	<p class="category intermediate">intermediate</p>
	<p>{% include categories/intermediate.md %}</p>
	<p class="category advanced">advanced</p>
	<p>{% include categories/advanced.md %}</p>
