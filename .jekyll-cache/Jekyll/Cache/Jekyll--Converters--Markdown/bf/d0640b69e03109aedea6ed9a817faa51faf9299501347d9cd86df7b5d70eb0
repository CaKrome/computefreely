I"Ç<p>As one of the oldest free software operating systems, Debian is renowned for its stability &amp; reliability. However given its complex development cycle, it is infrequently updated and a tendency to lag behind the competition in terms providing the latest and greatest software.</p>

<p>The Debian Project holds a steadfast adherence to Free Software, distributing Debian in accordance with the principles of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU Project</a> and has produced a strict <a href="https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">social contact</a> and set of <a href="https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">Free Software guidelines</a> to guide the development of Debian and inform its many contributors.</p>

<p>While the default desktop environment of Debian is <a href="/desktops/gnome">GNOME</a>, during installation you can pull from Debianâ€™s vast software respository of over 50000 packages to install virtually any other.</p>
