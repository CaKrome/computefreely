I"Õ<p>MX Linux is a cooperative venture between the <a href="https://antixlinux.com/">antiX</a> and former <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEPIS">MEPIS</a> communities to make a distribution that provides an elegant Xfce desktop with simple configuration with a focus on stability and efficient use of system resources.</p>

<p>While it can be installed onto most PCs, MX Linux is also built to run from a USB drive and function as a portable operating system.</p>
