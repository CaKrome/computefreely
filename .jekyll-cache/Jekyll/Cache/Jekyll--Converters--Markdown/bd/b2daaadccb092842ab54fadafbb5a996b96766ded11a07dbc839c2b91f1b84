I"-<p>Tails is a live operating system that you can run on almost any computer from the installation media. It is designed to preserving your privacy and anonymity, and helps you to use the Internet anonymously and circumvent censorship. It also provides state-of-the-art cryptographic tools to encrypt your files and communications.</p>

<p>Tails will leave no trace of itself on the computer you are using it on unless you ask explicitly and Internet connections are forced to go through the anonymizing Tor network so your web surfing cannot be traced.</p>
