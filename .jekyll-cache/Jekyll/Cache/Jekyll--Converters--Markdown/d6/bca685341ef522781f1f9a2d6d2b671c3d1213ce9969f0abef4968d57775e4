I"ı<p>Endless is a beginner-friendly distribution with an interface designed to ‚Äúfeel natural and intuitive‚Äù, taking cues from mobile operating systems and presenting apps as a grid of icons right on main screen.</p>

<p>Something unique to Endless is that it comes pre-loaded not just with plenty of desktop apps, but with a bunch web services and applications so they‚Äôre just one-click away. Even in their own software store, Endless treats web applications as equal to those of the desktop.</p>
